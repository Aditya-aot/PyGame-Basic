# PyGame-Basic

To install pygame on your platform, use the appropriate pip command:

$ pip install pygame
You can verify the install by loading one of the examples that comes with the library:

$ python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
If a game window appears, then pygame is installed properly! If you run into problems, then the Getting Started guide outlines some known issues and caveats for all platforms.
